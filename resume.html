    <blockquote>
        Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes.
        <div>-Walt Whitman</div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        I'm going to tell you who I am, and who I am not. You'll know I'm telling the truth because it's not all
        pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
        First and foremost, <strong>I love people</strong>. Aside from technology, I've spent the most time learning
        about people: <a href="http://www.petermichaud.com">psychology, communication, relationships</a>. If you want to
        understand why people do what they do, or you want to figure out how to convince them to do something else, I'm
        your man. A side effect is that I'm <strong>incredibly easy</strong> to get along with; I'm easy to like and I
        work hard to understand and listen hard.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>I love helping</strong>. If I hadn't gotten a handle on it when I was a young adult, my drive to help
        would be pathological. When I was young I would commit to helping everyone, doing their charity projects,
        editing their manuscripts, connecting them to the right people. And often, I'd fail them because I was over
        extended, stressed out, and I'd drop the ball. I can put you in touch with people today who will tell you I
        still have a dangerous "<strong>helpful</strong>" streak when it comes to giving too much and demanding too
        little. I'm still on the fence about whether it's really a liability.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like technology. I'm excited by the impact it can make on our lives, and I'm proud to be among the relatively
        few people (along with my fellow geeks) who can understand, follow, and occasionally contribute to the latest
        developments.
    </p>
    <p>
        But look, I don't <em>love</em> technology. When I was a kid, everyone assumed I'd grow up to be
        a software developer because that was the most employable of the things I was consistently interested in (as
        opposed to, say, <a href="http://www.peteart.com">art</a>). But I'd correct them, and say I only think it's fun,
        I don't really have a passion for it, in and of itself. I most often used it to meet some other goal of
        mine. If you had asked me when I was 11 what I wanted to do when I grow up, I would've answered "<strong>Save
        the World</strong>." The answer never really changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, I don't give a shit about the first world problem your startup is solving. I <em>enjoy</em> the
        technology, I really understand the hard work that goes into a startup, and I hope you make a <strong>trillion
        dollars</strong>. I might even do something similar again one day for my own trillion, if I think it'll help me
        save the world. Maybe even with you, if you convince me you can sell it.
    </p>
    <p>
        But frankly, cool technology isn't enough for me. I like playing with
        <a href="http://petemichaud.github.com/4dhypercube/">my toys</a> as much as the next geek, but if you're going
        to ask me to spend <em>my life</em> doing something, it better be to <strong>create a better world</strong>.
        Like I said, I have a nearly pathological need to help, on both a local and global scale.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I like you and I think your tech is cool, I'll come play with you for three to six months maybe. And I'll
        <strong>add a shit load of value</strong> while I'm there. I've been responsible for multimillion dollar
        projects that would ensure my victory in any game of buzzword bingo. I've started a
        <a href="http://techzinglive.com/page/187/techzing-38-pete-michaud-retired-at-25">successful internet company</a>
        (and lots more failed ones). I've worked deeply in several stacks including Ruby on Rails, .NET, and even PHP
        (that'll cost you extra, baby). I'm a ninja guru pirate whatever on the client side, since most of my work has
        been on the web, and that's the common denominator.
    </p>
    <p>
        I <em>am</em> a guy who can design your user experience and information architecture, build your backend in
        practically whatever technology you want, then do the statistical analysis on your user base and present the
        findings at a conference.
    </p>
    <p>
        I <em>am not</em> a guy you want to hire to maintain your widget that connects advertisers to their dogs. That
        won't end well for anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>I'm the guy you want to hire if you're trying to save the world and you need someone who has the fire and
        breadth of interest and skill to help you make that happen.</strong>

        <p>
            I've been doing this more or less continuously for 15 years, and my roles have changed over the years. 15
            years ago, I started building sites and applications for small businesses as a single developer, including
            interface, collateral, and identity design. I designed and developed .NET and LAMP-driven internal software
            systems for management of web site content, human resources, customer relations, and inventory. I still do
            some of that stuff, but over the years as the projects and clients have grown I've taken more architectural
            and project management oriented roles.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Improved client brand recognition by developing consistent graphic layout guidelines and marketing
                materials.</li>
            <li>Built web based business-to-consumer applications from specification to final deployment.</li>
            <li>Managed multimillion dollar projects for major web properties</li>

    <p>
        The idea was that since I was already a working software developer, I'd learn about business to round myself out.
        It turns out that I learned way more about business by <em>doing business</em> than I ever did at school, but
        that's not why I dropped out.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had straight As at UNF, Dean's List, Honors Program, the works. When family issues made it impossible to
        continue, I dropped out with 105 credits of the 120 I needed. Shit happens, it's not the hand you're dealt, it's
        what you do with the cards.

        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Addisons-Disease-Causes-Tests-Treatments/dp/1456303465/">Addison's Disease</a>,
        but they were through my company Kenrose Media, so they are under marketing pseudonyms, and they are
        mostly collaborative projects, and none of them have anything to do with technology.

        For something a little more traditional, and actually under my given name,  look for my upcoming title
        <strong>Achievement Porn</strong>, due out later this year.

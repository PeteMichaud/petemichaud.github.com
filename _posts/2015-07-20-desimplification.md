I'm so sad.

I don't even know where to start -- you guys call this desimplification, 
and it fucking sucks. 

I have a hypothesis that depression is a state that arises when there's 
no clear path to a goal. I know that requires the CT theory to be tweaked 
since CT posits that it's impossible to be actually disconnected from 
your goals, but it sure feels like I'm right. I feel untethered from my 
path, and helpless to reattach.

I've gone through a brutal transition from everything safe and good, into
 a black hole. 

I'm interested in the many technical challenges we face as a species in a 
hostile universe, but what's been true for me since I was very young is 
the sense that we're collectively missing something. TheÂ technical 
challenges are real, but they will be solved because they present 
themselves for solutions. 

It's the human challenges that are ignored--those challenges we can't even 
see because our worldview is so tied to them that we can't imagine anything 
different. It's the man who beats his wife because the universe is such 
that he has no choice but to be angry with her and such that anger requires 
him to hurt her. It's woman who thinks down to her fucking bones that there 
is actually a proper way to be in public, that shame is anything except a 
conceit we more or less agree to act out. It's lovers who think they are 
hurting because the other won't be or do something different.

It's a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of perception and true 
facts about the world that I view as an existential threat. People who know 
lots about information theory and neuroscience, but have no idea what their 
subjective experience actually corresponds to in reality are trying to build 
a goal-aligned super intelligence. People trying to do great things but 
melting down because they think something is actually threatened when their 
belief structure goes twirly.  
 
In the right circles these are known problems, with loosely understood 
solutions--many of which I developed personally. But the cultural divide 
is enormous. The groups have such a fundamentally different set of values 
that their perceptions clash at pretty much every level. The people who know 
anything about this are largely ineffectual navel gazers--I've looked. The 
people who can do anything are tightly geared toward cutting action that 
often lacks perspective. The usual response from both parties when I try to 
argue for the other side is "ok, but what's that good for?," or if I'm lucky
 "that seems interesting..." 

My experience has been that Relationalists are mildly curious about what it 
feels like to be so Rational. Rationalists want to know the parameters of 
relating so they can evaluate it, and either assimilate it or discard it. 

## My Failure

In Austin I built a community around these issues. I wanted to bridge 
the divide, I wanted to myself learn and also to show people what it was like 
to bring one's full attention to being human, and what that subjective 
experience actually corresponded to in reality. 

My community was about 600 strong locally, with a growing cadre of trained 
facilitators (more than work at Leverage by half) who looked to me for guidance 
and leadership. I had standing engagements to teach around the country. 
People who I personally trained and equipped had started similar communities 
in a dozen other cities. People flew in from other countries to attend my 
leadership training. 

I failed. 

I built a community of people who loved each other, and loved me. To greater and lesser degrees, they learned to take sole responsibility for themselves, and notice their own perception. They knew how to stand in their power, and gaze unflinching into another person's eyes. But to what end, I don't know. Did it truly improve their qualities of life? I don't know. Did they actually get anything useful that would impact the world meaningfully? I don't know. 

I left the community because I failed to bridge the gap in either direction--I couldn't convey the virtue of effective action to the relationalists, I couldn't convey the virtue of deep emotional mastery to the rationalists. Not in way that made either camp actually move differently. I realized that even if I could eventually do that, I didn't have a plan that would actually change the world. So I'd lend my support to a group that did have a plan, and hope I could move things in the right direction.

And when I left the community in the hands of my former partner to join Leverage, a few things happened that were painful for me.

1. She was upset at me for leaving her to fend for herself. There was no "thanks for all your hard work and dedication, you've given us a lot." It was: "fuck you for abandoning us."
2. She fumbled the ball. I had already concluded that the group would never have the impact I wanted it to have, but she was making leadership decisions that were threatening the longterm viability of even the local community--the small solace I could take from having built something that a few thousand people value and appreciate is currently going up in smoke. 
3. No one seemed to give a shit. I poured myself into that community, and when I left, a couple people knew what was going on, but most did not. When I disappeared I didn't make a big deal about it, I didn't want to disrupt things, and it wasn't clear how much I'd be participating. What I found was a deafening silence. Not one person to date, who wasn't already extremely close to me, has reached out to find out how I'm doing, or where I went.  

So, the thing I built was poorly conceived, poorly executed, will fail, and no one will remember or give a shit about it or about me. That sucks. 

And now I'm here. 

## Lost

I don't know how to convey the importance of what I know. Some of what I see at the house and in the EA movement writ large is heartening, and some of it is fucking terrifying.  

My many hard won skills are useless here. No one really needs software, no one is ready for precision business execution, or anything like traditional management, or art, or math. My psychology and relational knowledge is basically incompatible with CT. I'm too entwined to be effective at conflict resolution, and too far away from everyone to be an effective counselor. Not even my nutrition or body expertise are valuable here--they are just another debatable, movementless data point. (And who am I kidding? I haven't worked out or eaten properly in a month.)

I've come to the painful realization that in my current work I'm somewhere on the spectrum between irrelevant and easily replaceable. I believe the general sense is that I'm probably competent in a variety of areas, but I haven't found a way to convey much of any value here. 

I remind myself of a broken man, rejected for so long by his girlfriend, that he cheats on her to remind himself he's still desirable and valuable, even if it's just to anonymous strangers. Except instead of cheating, I'm working 80 hours a week churning out massive amounts of very complex software that will probably never see the light of day. 

Before I made the connection to feeling useless I was confused about why I was churning out useless, pretty software. 

I released a ruby gem that generates random numbers along a normal curve. I released packages on the Unity Asset Store that calculate the similarity of arbitrary strings, and another that can generate catchy human names from a possibility space of over 1.3 trillion names. I've done more than that, but the only reason I'm writing this is so you know how good and smart I am, and so through your reflection I can believe that about myself. This is the state my mind is in. I'm desperately clawing for something that says "You're good and useful!"

All initiative I try to show in earnest comes to nothing. I tried making a substantial contribution to Shift, I developed a new way of theorizing that I believed was promising, but it came to nothing. I've been no significant help in that project. I've built no fewer than 3 web applications trying to streamline and sexify the onboarding process for EAA. My work was not useful--I didn't make the right call about what we needed, I misfired on the execution, and as robust and pretty as the apps are, they are basically useless. We now have a brochure website that anyone with a few hours and google could've built. 

I'm very generously humored, and in reality, I am doing work that any bright intern could do. 

Aside from work, living here in the house is painful for me. All my rituals, habits, and procedures, carefully cultivated over decades to fit the contours of my quirks and hangups, don't work here. There's no way for me to control my space or my things or my privacy. All the psychologically relevant factors are actually not possible to adjust in a large group housing situation. I can't afford something different. I also feel guilty and broken for this. Everyone here has been nothing but kind, understanding, and accommodating to me. Most people here seem to get along just fine with the way things are. Yet my transition to the Bay from my beautiful, quiet, perfectly clean, perfectly organized sanctuary in Austin is always painful. Only being able to hold my beautiful wife makes it worth the trip for all the discomfort.

## Burning

And what's maybe the hardest part of this is that the help I can find 
here is not what I want or need. I want to hide because I'm afraid 
of what comes after I reveal the pain I'm in. I feel deep gratitude 
for the earnest willingness to support and help. The deep commitment 
to robustly lending service--I see it, I feel it, I appreciate it. But 
I don't need it or want it.

In Austin, I painted a mural on my wall, above my fireplace: 

![Burning Monk Mural](/images/burning_monk_mural.jpg)

It's a burning monk, something like my power animal. Larger than life, 
towering above me every morning as I wake up, reminding me of what's 
real and who I am. 

There's a deep piece of me that was forged in fire and betrayal and 
death. Forged in loss with no silver lining, and pain with no solace 
or lesson to learn--just destitute, wretched grief. That place is 
harder and hotter than the challenges of this world. It cannot be 
broken or moved, it is my deepest sanctuary.

I've been pushed back to that last safe place inside of me more times 
than I should have been as a man who is only 30. That's where I sit and 
burn in perfect bliss, like my monk. 

It's a slow burn, and thorough. It's a flame that devours every timber 
and brick of the recursing tower of bullshit I occasionally build 
around what's real about me. It eats through my ego and my 
pretensions, my bitter, my shallow, my fear, and my hope. 

I don't fight it, and I don't want you to fight it for me. I will 
savor each note of the pain, and watch the details of my weakness 
and brokenness pass by in vivid relief. It cannot be hurried or 
dissected. 

It's not because I can't stop it, but because I want it. 

When I'm done burning, there will nothing left but the truth. 
The only true thing about me is that I am Joy, and I am Fierce 
Love. The kind of love you can't quench with sadness or rage or 
disappointment--or desimplification, or culture shock, or discomfort.

I've sat in this place and burned many times before. I view it as 
something of a sacred rite of rebirth. Far from being distant or 
disconnected, I'm more present while burning than most times of my 
life. I'm engaged in every nuance of my experience of myself and 
of you. I'm letting you into my heart and mind in ways I can't 
begin to express. That's why attempts to help and your frustration
feel so sharp to me.

Too much is happening inside to interact with you normally,
but I am right there with you.

I don't want to shortcut it, and I can't narrate it to you it as 
it's happening. I can only sit in stillness, feeling my body explode 
one atom at a time.

What I need from you as I burn isn't water or a thick blanket. I 
need gentle patience. 

I won't be violent or volatile. I may sit and look at nothing. I may 
seem mad or sad or scared. You are watching as I burn, and I welcome 
you to witness it. But it's not a well-lit lecture hall, with notes 
and analysis and office hours. It's a secret basement in an ancient 
church, with lurking ghosts and runes lit by candles. My private 
ritual of sacred purification, and you the reverent witness.

Anything less from you feels like a well-meaning betrayal. An uncouth 
interruption of sacred ritual. An accidental show of disrespect for 
foreign gods and rites you don't see and can't know, that live deep 
in my fabric, on an island, forged unbreakable and unmoving.

And when I'm smoldering and ashen and pure and new, I'll smell different, 
I'll move differently, I'll have a different look in my eye. All the 
untrue things I wrote above will be burned away and in their place I will
stand as I truly am, unbroken and unbreakable. 

For now, I burn.

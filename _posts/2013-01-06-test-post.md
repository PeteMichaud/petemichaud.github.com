<p class="meta">January 6th, 2013 - Austin, Texas</p>

I've been blogging for years, and in that time I've tried to shoehorn all the things I'm interested in into the same
site, which turns out to be like packing a wild hyena and a honey badger into the same giant ziploc bag. It sounds
exciting, but it just ends up smelling bad after the flailing stops.

I have a few wide areas of interest.

The areas that's gotten the most airtime in my writing is psychology and spirituality. I write mostly about that on [my
blog at PeteMichaud.com](http://www.petermichaud.com), and it's one of my longest running and most popular blogs.

Another major area of interest for me is art. I showcase some of [my artwork at PeteArt.com](http://www.peteart.com).

The last area I'll bloviate about is technical. I am a software developer and occasional math geek. I've never
had a dedicated outlet to talk about my work since I've been busy, well, *working*. But now I want to. I have a few
interesting things to share, and talking about them on a psychology blog won't really do it. So here I am.

I like having my silos of thought because although they mix freely in my skull, talking about All The Things&trade; on
one site is a great way to confuse and alienate readers. I'd prefer to confuse and alienate readers one topic at a time.

Now I can. Watch out.

[Hypercube](https://github.com/PeteMichaud/hypercube) is a JavaScript toy thatâ€™s sort of pretty, and kind of fun. It
uses trigonometry to place "vertices" in a 3D configuration. It was written before HTML5 and canvas were things, it uses
html characters as the vertices.

[Click here to check out the demo](http://petemichaud.github.com/hypercube). Follow the instructions carefully.

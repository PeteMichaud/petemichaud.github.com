    <h2>Open Cover Letter</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>I love people, and I love helping</strong>. Aside from technology, I've spent the most time learning
        about people: psychology, communication, relationships. If you want to understand why people do what they do I'm
        your man. A side effect is that I'm <strong>incredibly easy</strong> to get along with; I'm easy to like and I
        listen hard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Technology is what I do though. I'm excited by the impact it can make on our lives, and I'm proud to be among
        the people who can understand, follow, and occasionally contribute to the latest developments.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have an interesting tech problem, I'll come help you with it. And I'll <strong>add a ton of value</strong>
        while I'm there. I've been responsible for multimillion dollar
        projects that would ensure my victory in any game of buzzword bingo. I've started a
        <a href="http://techzinglive.com/page/187/techzing-38-pete-michaud-retired-at-25">successful internet company</a>
        (and lots more failed ones). I've worked deeply in several stacks including Ruby on Rails, .NET, and even PHP.
        I have deep expertise with JavaScript and HTML, since most of my work has been on the web, and that's
        the common denominator.
    </p>
    <p>
        I <em>am</em> a guy who can design your user experience and information architecture, build your backend in
        practically whatever technology you want, then do the statistical analysis on your user base and present the
        findings at a conference. <a href="mailto:me@petermichaud.com">Get in touch with me</a>, and we'll make your
        project a reality.

        <p>
            I've been doing this more or less continuously for 15 years, and my roles have changed over the years. 15
            years ago, I started building sites and applications for small businesses as a single developer, including
            interface, collateral, and identity design. I designed and developed .NET and LAMP-driven internal software
            systems for management of web site content, human resources, customer relations, and inventory. I still do
            some of that stuff, but over the years as the projects and clients have grown I've taken more architectural
            and project management oriented roles.
